# d2x-ctfc
- Flags spawn in the home cube (first one)
- Scoring only when own flag present home (if multiple homes doesn't matter which one)
- Flag returning automatically when carrier dies.
- Team score increase only when capture (prevent defense camping for points)
- Individual score increase when killed opponent or decrease when teamkill or suicide.
- Level design player starting positions compatible with jinxes CCTF

Issues:
- Make primaries spawn in the level instead of spew (spew clouds in one spot - one home - are a problem) - all other games fix this by fixed weapon respawn spots - D2 doesn't have that.

Plans:
- Make respawn delayed (jinx cctf compatible) for tactical reasons
- Provide additional individual score increase for:
'Defense' - killing opponent who has the flag 5pts (instead of just 1 for regular kill)
'Capture' - Capturing the flag 10pts
