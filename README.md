Done:
- Flags spawn in home base
- Flag returns to the base when carrier dies
- To score the flag your own flag must be present home
- Disabled flag drop
- Killed ship spew doesn't contain primary weapons (except laser upgrades) and accessories - all these spawn in the level at the time of death.
- Odd spawn positions on the level belong to Red team, even positions to Blue team
